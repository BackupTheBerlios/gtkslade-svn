Gtk-SLADE changelog
-------------------

Goes in bottom-up order

*: Fixed
+: Added
-: Removed
~: Changed


[27/09/05]
+ Added the rest of the infobar stuff (minus stuff that needs textures/game configs)
+ Added 'blend' variable to rgba_t, now blend modes can be specified for colour config colours:
	-1 = doesn't matter, 0 = normal, 1 = additive
+ Basic line information shows up (minus the special name and side info)
+ Colour configuration can be changed via the console
+ Added back the SLADE colour configurations
+ The main linedef edit dialog works now (except 'change special' which needs game configs)
+ Implemented basic thing drawing (grey squares until I get game configs and textures loading)
+ Added a menu and toolbar to the editor window, with some nice icons I made ;)
~ Moved back to GTK 2.6 until there is a decent 2.8 win32 port (the official one has much too small fonts)
* Fixed a linux crash in setup_game_combo

[22/09/05]
+ Added console command parsing. Now it's just as functional as the original SLADE 3d mode console ;)
+ Added a function to wait for all gtk events, needed for the console and eventually for the splash screen and any progress bars.
