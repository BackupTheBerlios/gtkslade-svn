Goes in bottom-up order

*: Fixed
+: Added
-: Removed
~: Changed
': Note

[21/11/05]
~ Right clicking no longer begins an item move (it doesn't start until the mouse is moved while right click is held)

+ Added 3d mode options to the preferences dialog
~ Sprites are no longer 'stretched' when allow_np2_tex is off
+ Added exit/close confirmation when there are unsaved changes
~ Changed how map changes are handled (now moving a thing doesn't require the gl nodes to be rebuilt etc etc)
+ Added search to texture browser

[19/11/05]
+ Texture browser can now be navigated with the arrow keys
+ Added texture paint function (shift+p by default, instead of the old shift+click)
+ Missing textures ("-") are now a blue/white checkerboard, invalid textures are the old red/black
+ Opening a recent wad will move it to the top of the list
+ New wads created are now added to the recent wads list

+ Added line trigger selection to line edit dialog
+ Added thing boxes and editing in 3d mode

[16/11/05]
* Wad manager window is now centered
* Maps with over 32767 sidedefs no longer crash SLADE
+ Added some checks to prevent crashes if map data is corrupted
+ Added 'recent wads' list to wad manager window

[14/11/05]
* Texture boxes on the line info bar weren't cleared if their side didn't exist
+ Added most of the old 3d editing features (except for the automatic texture alignment and 'paint texture' features, they need a rewrite)

[13/11/05]
+ Added wall & flat hilighting, ready for 3d editing
~ Changed the way line data is setup in 3d mode to make line hilighting (for 3d editing) easier

[10/11/05]
+ Added slopes stuff to 3d mode
+ Binds are now saved to slade.cfg
+ Added input configuration to the preferences dialog

[09/11/05]
+ Added 'splash' command to the console, initially for testing, but added some fun stuff :P
* Hopefully fixed 3d mode flickering, again :P
+ Added a proper splash screen (instead of just popping up the console like before)
' Moved over to VC++ 2005 Express, now intellisense works with GTK. No more constantly checking the API docs ;)

[07/11/05]
* Right clicking a texture box on the side edit dialog no longer clears the texture
+ Added 'sector reference' entry to the side edit dialog
* X and Y offset entry boxes weren't setup properly on the side edit dialog

[06/11/05]
~ Moved game iwads out of the game configurations and into their own section in slade.cfg. (If a game's IWAD isn't specified, the user is asked to browse for it)
+ 3d Mode is now fully textured ;)

[02/11/05]
+ Flats are now rendered, I also have everything ready for slopes again

[31/10/05]
+ 3d mode movement controls added
+ Basic untextured walls are now drawn in 3d mode ;)

[27/10/05]
* Fixed the 'notex' texture showing up all white
+ Added sector editing functions (stuff in the edit->sector menu: join, merge, create door, create stairs)

[21/10/05]
+ Added a functional scripts editor (no hilighting or anything fancy yet, though)
+ SCRIPTS and BEHAVIOR lumps are no longer overwritten when saving a map that already had them

[20/10/05]
+ Added the up and down keys to the console window entry to cycle through previously entered commands
+ Added a z height entry to the thing edit dialog (totally forgot about this before :P)
* Fixed an error in the map saving that caused thing args to be saved wrong
+ Added save/save as, which officially makes it a (basic) fully-functional editor ;)
+ Finished the sector edit dialog (including boom generalized sector specials)
+ Implemented the 'change' buttons on the arg editor
+ Sector edit dialog is mostly finished (only need to add special selection and generalized flags)
+ Sector specials are loaded from game configurations and displayed on the sector info bar

[19/10/05]
+ Started on the sector edit dialog

+ Arg types are now read from game configurations
* Fixed crash when clicking in blank space in the texture browser
+ Added tex_filter cvar to control texture filtering
+ Added the 'visual' tab to the preferences dialog

[18/10/05]
+ Valid map names are now read from game configurations (if defined)
+ Clicking on the sprite image in the thing edit dialog now brings up the thing browser, so it's consistent with the line edit dialog (clicking the textures opens the texture browser)
+ Texture browser now scrolls to the currently hilighted texture when appropriate
* Fixed a possible crash on undo
+ Re-added quick thing angle selection (hold and drag the middle mouse button)
+ Added double right click in the editor window to edit an item
+ Double-clicking a texture in the browser now selects that texture
~ Changed to GTK-2.8, now that there is finally a gladewin32 gtk2.8 package
+ Added cvar 'allow_np2_tex'. If set to false, non-power-of-two textures will be resized. Should be set to true only if the video card supports opengl 2.0.

[17/10/05]
+ Added TID and action special selection to the thing edit dialog
+ Re-added drawing things as sprites on the 2d editor (cvar thing_sprites)
+ Mouse scroll wheel now works in the texture browser
+ Added thing type and angle selection to the thing edit dialog (including thing browser)
+ Added action special selection dialog
+ Texture names are now shown in the texture browser

[16/10/05]
+ Defaults are now read from game configurations again (something I forgot to do before)
+ Added in the old text drawing code
+ Textures can now be selected from the texture browser (mouse only for now)
' Got a nice new 19" LCD monitor after my old 17" CRT died ;)

[14/10/05]
+ The texture browser is up, can't do anything but view the textures for now.
~ Changed the texture system to use opengl textures instead of pixbufs, since they were proving too slow for the texture browser.

[07/10/05]
+ Started on the texture browser
+ Started on the sidedef part of the line edit dialog

[06/10/05]
* Fixed crash when creating a new thing (wasn't updating it's thing definition)
~ Replaced all the images on the info bar with my new tex_box_t structs. Makes things much easier (from a programming perspective :P)

[05/10/05]
+ Started on thing edit dialog

[02/10/05]
~ Changed default interpolation to bilinear
* Transparency now loads correctly (I was setting the default palette entry to 0 instead of 247)
+ Finished the line info bar

[01/10/05]
+ Added borders and backgrounds for textures on the info bar
+ Added thing types and sprites to thing info bar
+ Thing types are now loaded from game configurations
+ Action specials are now loaded from game configurations
+ Added ability to create and save colour configurations
+ Added a 'preferences' dialog, and merged the colour configuration dialog into it

[30/09/05]
+ Added flat images to the sector info bar
+ Flats are now loaded
+ Added a progress bar to the console when loading textures
* Textures on the line info bar are now scaled correctly (probably a bit small for my liking though, but theres not much that can be done about that)
* Fixed texture loading stuff, now they are loaded on-demand.
+ Added basic texture loading. For now all textures are loaded as pixbufs. I can't quite figure out how to generate them on the fly (which is plenty fast enough) without it chewing up ram like nothing because the generated pixbufs aren't being deleted. It's times like these i'm beginning to regret moving away from gtkmm and it's nice memory management :P
+ Finished up the wad manager window, it's now (nearly) fully functional.
~ Changed the editor window to be the 'main' window (rather than the 'wad manager window' as its called now).

[29/09/05]
+ Implemented tag hilighting. I had the colour there, but I haven't actually had the feature implemented ever :P (It was in the very first SLADE, but I never re-implemented it after the rewrite post-0.1)
+ Added a colour configuration dialog, which mostly works except for creating/saving new schemes. Couple other problems with it too I need to sort out.
~ Reworked the colour configurations a bit (now they are in seperate files rather than one)

[28/09/05]
~ Converted a bunch of ints to doubles. Now working at very high zoom levels is much more accurate

[27/09/05]
+ Added the rest of the infobar stuff (minus stuff that needs textures/game configs)
+ Added 'blend' variable to rgba_t, now blend modes can be specified for colour config colours:
	-1 = doesn't matter, 0 = normal, 1 = additive
+ Basic line information shows up (minus the special name and side info)
+ Colour configuration can be changed via the console
+ Added back the SLADE colour configurations
+ The main linedef edit dialog works now (except 'change special' which needs game configs)
+ Implemented basic thing drawing (grey squares until I get game configs and textures loading)
+ Added a menu and toolbar to the editor window, with some nice icons I made ;)
~ Moved back to GTK 2.6 until there is a decent 2.8 win32 port (the official one has much too small fonts)
* Fixed a linux crash in setup_game_combo

[22/09/05]
+ Added console command parsing. Now it's just as functional as the original SLADE 3d mode console ;)
+ Added a function to wait for all gtk events, needed for the console and eventually for the splash screen and any progress bars.
