Gtk-SLADE changelog
-------------------

Goes in bottom-up order

*: Fixed
+: Added
-: Removed
~: Changed

[30/09/05]
* Textures on the line info bar are now scaled correctly (probably a bit small for my liking though, but theres not much that can be done about that)
* Fixed texture loading stuff, now they are loaded on-demand.
+ Added basic texture loading. For now all textures are loaded as pixbufs. I can't quite figure out how to generate them on the fly (which is plenty fast enough) without it chewing up ram like nothing because the generated pixbufs aren't being deleted. It's times like these i'm beginning to regret moving away from gtkmm and it's nice memory management :P
+ Finished up the wad manager window, it's now (nearly) fully functional.
~ Changed the editor window to be the 'main' window (rather than the 'wad manager window' as its called now).

[29/09/05]
+ Implemented tag hilighting. I had the colour there, but I haven't actually had the feature implemented ever :P (It was in the very first SLADE, but I never re-implemented it after the rewrite post-0.1)
+ Added a colour configuration dialog, which mostly works except for creating/saving new schemes. Couple other problems with it too I need to sort out.
~ Reworked the colour configurations a bit (now they are in seperate files rather than one)

[28/09/05]
~ Converted a bunch of ints to doubles. Now working at very high zoom levels is much more accurate

[27/09/05]
+ Added the rest of the infobar stuff (minus stuff that needs textures/game configs)
+ Added 'blend' variable to rgba_t, now blend modes can be specified for colour config colours:
	-1 = doesn't matter, 0 = normal, 1 = additive
+ Basic line information shows up (minus the special name and side info)
+ Colour configuration can be changed via the console
+ Added back the SLADE colour configurations
+ The main linedef edit dialog works now (except 'change special' which needs game configs)
+ Implemented basic thing drawing (grey squares until I get game configs and textures loading)
+ Added a menu and toolbar to the editor window, with some nice icons I made ;)
~ Moved back to GTK 2.6 until there is a decent 2.8 win32 port (the official one has much too small fonts)
* Fixed a linux crash in setup_game_combo

[22/09/05]
+ Added console command parsing. Now it's just as functional as the original SLADE 3d mode console ;)
+ Added a function to wait for all gtk events, needed for the console and eventually for the splash screen and any progress bars.
