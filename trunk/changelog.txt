*: Fixed

-: Removed
~: Changed
': Note

[17/10/05]
+ Added action special selection dialog
+ Texture names are now shown in the texture browser

[16/10/05]
+ Defaults are now read from game configurations again (something I forgot to do before)
+ Added in the old text drawing code
+ Textures can now be selected from the texture browser (mouse only for now)
' Got a nice new 19" LCD monitor after my old 17" CRT died ;)

[14/10/05]
+ The texture browser is up, can't do anything but view the textures for now.
~ Changed the texture system to use opengl textures instead of pixbufs, since they were proving too slow for the texture browser.

[07/10/05]
+ Started on the texture browser
+ Started on the sidedef part of the line edit dialog

[06/10/05]
* Fixed crash when creating a new thing (wasn't updating it's thing definition)
~ Replaced all the images on the info bar with my new tex_box_t structs. Makes things much easier (from a programming perspective :P)

[05/10/05]
+ Started on thing edit dialog

[02/10/05]
~ Changed default interpolation to bilinear
* Transparency now loads correctly (I was setting the default palette entry to 0 instead of 247)
+ Finished the line info bar

[01/10/05]
+ Added borders and backgrounds for textures on the info bar
+ Added thing types and sprites to thing info bar
+ Thing types are now loaded from game configurations
+ Action specials are now loaded from game configurations
+ Added ability to create and save colour configurations
+ Added a 'preferences' dialog, and merged the colour configuration dialog into it

[30/09/05]
+ Added flat images to the sector info bar
+ Flats are now loaded
+ Added a progress bar to the console when loading textures
* Textures on the line info bar are now scaled correctly (probably a bit small for my liking though, but theres not much that can be done about that)
* Fixed texture loading stuff, now they are loaded on-demand.
+ Added basic texture loading. For now all textures are loaded as pixbufs. I can't quite figure out how to generate them on the fly (which is plenty fast enough) without it chewing up ram like nothing because the generated pixbufs aren't being deleted. It's times like these i'm beginning to regret moving away from gtkmm and it's nice memory management :P
+ Finished up the wad manager window, it's now (nearly) fully functional.
~ Changed the editor window to be the 'main' window (rather than the 'wad manager window' as its called now).

[29/09/05]
+ Implemented tag hilighting. I had the colour there, but I haven't actually had the feature implemented ever :P (It was in the very first SLADE, but I never re-implemented it after the rewrite post-0.1)
+ Added a colour configuration dialog, which mostly works except for creating/saving new schemes. Couple other problems with it too I need to sort out.
~ Reworked the colour configurations a bit (now they are in seperate files rather than one)

[28/09/05]
~ Converted a bunch of ints to doubles. Now working at very high zoom levels is much more accurate

[27/09/05]
+ Added the rest of the infobar stuff (minus stuff that needs textures/game configs)
+ Added 'blend' variable to rgba_t, now blend modes can be specified for colour config colours:
	-1 = doesn't matter, 0 = normal, 1 = additive
+ Basic line information shows up (minus the special name and side info)
+ Colour configuration can be changed via the console
+ Added back the SLADE colour configurations
+ The main linedef edit dialog works now (except 'change special' which needs game configs)
+ Implemented basic thing drawing (grey squares until I get game configs and textures loading)
+ Added a menu and toolbar to the editor window, with some nice icons I made ;)
~ Moved back to GTK 2.6 until there is a decent 2.8 win32 port (the official one has much too small fonts)
* Fixed a linux crash in setup_game_combo

[22/09/05]
+ Added console command parsing. Now it's just as functional as the original SLADE 3d mode console ;)
+ Added a function to wait for all gtk events, needed for the console and eventually for the splash screen and any progress bars.
